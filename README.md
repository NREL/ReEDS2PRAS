# ReEDS2PRAS
ReEDS2PRAS

The purpose of ReEDS2PRAS is to translate completed ReEDS runs into PRAS systems ready for probabilistic resource adequacy analysis.

ReEDS2PRAS can be added in the Julia REPL from its git URL

`] add https://github.nrel.gov/PRAS/ReEDS2PRAS.git`
 
Assuming  the user can access the julia REPL and clone ReEDS2PRAS, the other necessary component for running standalone ReEDS2PRAS is a completed ReEDS run. More information about running ReEDS is available at `https://github.nrel.gov/ReEDS/ReEDS-2.0`.

If you have a completed ReEDS run and a REPL with ReEDS2PRAS, an example of running ReEDS to PRAS is provided below
