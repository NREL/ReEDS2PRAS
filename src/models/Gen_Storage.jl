"""
    This code defines a struct called Gen_Storage which is a subtype of
    Storage. The struct has 14 fields: name, timesteps, region_name, type,
    charge_cap, discharge_cap, energy_cap, inflow, grid_withdrawl_cap,
    grid_inj_cap, legacy, charge_eff, discharge_eff and carryover_eff. The
    code also contains an inner constructor and checks to ensure that the
    values passed are valid. Specifically, all capacity values must be 
    greater than or equal to 0.0,the legacy value must either be “Existing” 
    or “New”, all of the efficiency values must be between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive),
    FOR must be between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive) and MTTR must be greater than 0.
    Additionally, there is a commented out check that verifies that all of
    the time series data is of the same size. Finally, if any of these
    checks fail, an error will be thrown.
